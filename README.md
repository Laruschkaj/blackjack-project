# blackjack-project
A React application that simulates the beginning of a Blackjack game. It automatically deals two unique cards from a 52-card deck, calculates their total score, and displays a "BLACKJACK!!!" message if the score is 21. This project focuses on React components, props, conditional rendering, and dynamic card generation.
